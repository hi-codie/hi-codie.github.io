      <h2>About Codie</h2>
      <p>Originally formed in Brooklyn in 2017, Codie has performed together through breakups, babies, moves and pandemics — IRL and online. With its members developing individual practices apart but always coming back together, the trio's oeuvre is testament to the push and pull of collective creation.</p>
      
      <p>This movement itself is echoed in the collective's shared approach. With sounds and images brought together not through OSC or audio-reactive technologies, but through the experience of viewers, each Codie performance or film is an investigation into the relationship between being alone and being together.</p>
      
      <p>In this show, you are invited to explore each artist's work as well as the collective's, mixing and matching sounds and views, arranging and re-arranging</p>

      <p><strong>Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo</strong> is an artist, programmer, and erstwhile data designer. Her work focuses on using the digital in a manner that can transcend its squalid and militaristic roots and reach out towards the sublime. She has created data-obscured art sites, new computer languages, and hybrid nostalgia machines. Her current focus is livecoded performances and abstract digital installations. For both, she makes use of image processing tools new and old, from the Jones frame buffer to a time-based SVG framework she developed herself.<p>
        
      <p>Sarah is an alumna of the School for Poetic Computation, Recurse Center, Brown University, and NYU Tandon School of Engineering. In addition to a solo exhibition as part of Wallplay's On Canal series, she has taken part in group shows at Sonar+D, Westbeth, Day for Night, Flux Factory, and Denver Supernova. Born in Southern California, Sarah lives and works in New York and Berlin. </p>
